## Project Description

The objective for this redesign project is to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and intuitive website for the FESC by utilizing modern web development practices to increase viewership and ultimately an awareness for sustainable practices of energy usage among industry professionals.


## Google Charts
[Column Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart)
I used a column chart for the renewable energy data. It's definitely not the most exciting format, 
but I feel like the other charts available would have convoluted the information that needs to be presented here. All we really need for this data set is an X and a Y value to represent each year and the amount of energy produced, which the column style provides without distorting the information. 


[Line Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart)
I would have used a bar format again for the energy consumption chart, as this data is very similar to the renewable energy chart, but I wanted to try a different style to give the page some contrast. That being said, I feel as though the line chart is equally as suitable for both sets of data as it utilizes an X and Y axis to draw the data set.
